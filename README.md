# Hello developer!

This is one of the many templates available from W3schools.

Check our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to learn the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) 🦄

# What's next?

Customize this template to make it your own. Remember to make your layout responsive - if you want your site to look good on smaller screens like mobile.

# Where to find everything

- **External style sheet:** The template you chose is built with [W3CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp), placed in an external style sheet. You can either replace that style sheet - or keep it simple and leave it in.

- **Fonts:** Explore the options from [Google fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_fonts_google.asp) and add your favorite.

- **Icons:** Icons are from [Fontawesome](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome5_intro.asp). You can reuse those and choose other free icons from their free library.

- **Images:** Replace the [images](https://support.w3schools.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4410414928017) by uploading your own and updating their URLs.


- **Tip:** Set up [Google Analytics](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_analytics.asp) to get valuable insights about your space and visitors.
