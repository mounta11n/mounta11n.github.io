### what does that mean?

I had to remind myself why I’m writing this blog at all: First and foremost, I write for myself. For the pleasure of writing, to keep notes and to structure thoughts. If any of this turns out to be useful for others, great, glad I could help. No need to spy on my visitors.

simplicity
maintainability
